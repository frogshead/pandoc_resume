# Software Test Engineer

As my long term professional career plan, your open postion of [Software Test Engineer](https://avoimettyopaikat.monster.fi/Software-Test-Engineer-Vantaa-UUSI-FI-Danfoss-Drives/11/193478145?WT.mc_n=CRM_B2C_FI_FI_ONG_E_LRRJ_STD_RJ7) seems like natural next step on my career. Over the last years I have driven myself towards professional software developer career and especially I try to head on embedded side. As my current position I do already software development but it is lacking the embedded side of the plan.

In my current position at Enics I wear two hats, one is software developer focusing test data collection software and the other one is test design engineer for production and product verification. Mainly developing functional, hipot and boundary-scan test systems. 

I hope you see my experience beneficial to your company, as well as to open position.  And my attitude to learn embedded sw development as a promise for hard work and dedication. 

Please contact me if there is anything you want know more, I am pleased to answer.
